# Parallel Programming Languages and Systems

This repository contains my coursework for the 5th Year [Parallel Programming Languages and Systems](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/ppls/) course, taken in 2012/2013. There were two pieces of coursework for the PPLS course: the first was a purely written exercise based on solving parallel programming problems, while second was half programming in MPI, and half critically evaluating a parallel programming model (the [BSP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel) model).

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
